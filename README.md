## What is Memory and How to Manipulate Memory

### Understanding Memory
Memory is a fundamental component of a computer system where data and instructions are stored. In the context of game hacking, memory refers to the volatile memory of the game's process, where important variables, values, and game states reside. By manipulating the memory, we can alter these variables and gain control over various aspects of the game.

![Memory https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Virtual_memory.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Virtual_memory.svg)

### What is Virtual Memory?

Virtual memory is a memory management technique employed by modern operating systems to provide each process with a virtual address space that is independent of the physical memory available in the system. It allows programs to operate as if they have access to a larger amount of memory than what is physically installed. This virtual address space is divided into smaller units called pages, which can be mapped to physical memory or stored on secondary storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs).

### How Does Virtual Memory Work?

When a program is executed, it is loaded into the virtual address space, which is typically divided into multiple segments, such as code, data, and stack. The virtual memory system maps the virtual addresses used by the program to physical addresses in the physical memory or secondary storage. This mapping is managed by the operating system's memory management unit (MMU) in collaboration with the hardware.

### Benefits of Virtual Memory

#### 1. Increased Addressable Memory

Virtual memory allows each process to have its own virtual address space, which can be much larger than the physical memory available in the system. This enables programs to execute and utilize more memory than what is physically installed, improving the system's ability to run larger and more complex applications.

#### 2. Memory Isolation and Protection

Virtual memory provides memory isolation between different processes, ensuring that each process has its own dedicated address space. This isolation prevents one process from accessing or modifying the memory of another process, enhancing security and stability. Additionally, virtual memory enables memory protection mechanisms, such as read-only memory regions and no-execution memory areas, to safeguard against unauthorized access and code execution.

#### 3. Efficient Memory Utilization

Virtual memory allows for efficient memory utilization by storing portions of the program that are not actively being used in secondary storage, such as the hard drive or SSD. This frees up physical memory for processes that require immediate access. The operating system dynamically manages the movement of data between physical memory and secondary storage based on usage patterns, optimizing overall system performance.

#### 4. Memory Sharing

Virtual memory facilitates memory sharing between processes. Multiple processes can map the same portion of a file into their virtual address spaces, enabling efficient resource utilization and communication between processes. This is particularly useful for inter-process communication and shared libraries.

#### Impact on System Performance

Virtual memory, when used effectively, can enhance system performance. However, excessive swapping of data between physical memory and secondary storage, known as thrashing, can lead to performance degradation. To mitigate this, the operating system employs various strategies, such as intelligent page replacement algorithms and pre-fetching techniques, to minimize the frequency of data swaps and optimize memory access.

### Locating Memory Addresses
To manipulate memory effectively, we need to locate the specific memory addresses associated with the variables we want to modify. Memory addresses act as unique identifiers for each piece of data stored in the game's memory. We can use memory scanning techniques to search for these addresses based on certain criteria, such as the current value of the variable or its data type.

### Modifying Memory
Once we've identified the memory addresses, we can modify the values stored at those addresses to achieve the desired changes in the game. This can involve increasing resources, adjusting health or stamina levels, or unlocking hidden features. Memory modification techniques typically involve reading the current value from a memory address, performing the necessary calculations or changes, and writing the modified value back to the same address.

### Pointers and Dynamic Memory Analysis
In more complex game-hacking scenarios, we may encounter dynamic memory structures and pointers. Pointers are memory addresses that point to other memory locations. They are commonly used to access dynamically allocated memory or navigate through complex data structures. Understanding pointers and performing dynamic memory analysis allows us to traverse the game's memory space more effectively and locate the desired variables or structures for manipulation.

## Behind the Scenes: Understanding Memory Manipulation in Game Hacking
Memory manipulation lies at the core of many game hacking techniques. Here, we take you behind the scenes and explore the intricacies of memory manipulation. Discover how to locate and modify specific memory addresses to alter in-game variables, unlock hidden features, and gain an unfair advantage. We'll cover concepts like static and dynamic memory analysis, pointers, and memory scanning techniques, equipping you with the knowledge to manipulate game memory effectively.

### Tools for Memory Manipulation
Several tools are available to aid in memory manipulation for game hacking. Memory editors or trainers provide a user-friendly interface to scan and modify memory values in real time during gameplay. Debuggers, such as **Cheat Engine** or **OllyDbg**, allow for more advanced memory manipulation and dynamic analysis by providing features like breakpoints, memory inspection, and disassembly. These tools simplify the process of locating and manipulating memory addresses, enabling game hackers to make precise and efficient changes.

Remember, game hacking through memory manipulation requires a thorough understanding of the game's memory structure, programming concepts, and relevant tools. It's essential to approach memory manipulation responsibly and ethically, ensuring that the changes made enhance your gaming experience without disrupting the intended gameplay or negatively affecting others.

## Cheat Engine: Harnessing the Power of Memory Editing

## Using C++ for Memory Manipulation Code

### Manipulating our Money

#### Finding Offsets

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Cheat Engine to find out what accesses a particular address:

- Start Cheat Engine and launch the game you want to cheat in.
- In Cheat Engine, click on the "Select a process to open" button (computer icon) in the top-left corner of the Cheat Engine window. It will open a process list.
- Select the process of the game you want to cheat in from the process list and click the "Open" button.
- In the Cheat Engine window, click on the "Scan" button (magnifying glass icon) to open the "Value Scan" window.
In the "Value" field, enter the memory address you want to investigate and select the appropriate value type (e.g., 4 bytes for integers).
- Click the "First Scan" button. Cheat Engine will search for all instances of the entered value in the game's memory.
- After the scan is complete, you should see a list of addresses in the left pane of Cheat Engine.
- Double-click on the desired address to add it to the bottom pane.
- Right-click on the added address and select "Find out what accesses this address" from the context menu.
- Cheat Engine will open the "Cheat Engine Disassembler" window, displaying the assembly instructions related to the address you selected.
- You can set breakpoints or step through the code to analyze what accesses or modifies the address.

![Cheat Engine finding offsets](https://i.imgur.com/0JtdSrr.png)

Let's break down the given assembly code and explain its functionality:

1. `mov ecx, [ecx + 140f0]`: This instruction moves the value at memory address `[ecx + 140f0]` into the `ecx` register. The `ecx` register is being used as a pointer or address holder.

2. `imul eax, eax, fc8`: This instruction multiplies the value in the `eax` register by the constant value `fc8` (which is in hexadecimal notation). The result is stored back in the `eax` register. This multiplication operation is likely used for some kind of calculation.

3. `mov esi, [ecx + eax + 5d0]`: This instruction moves the value at memory address `[ecx + eax + 5d0]` into the `esi` register. The value being loaded into `esi` is the money value. The memory address is calculated by adding the contents of `ecx` and `eax` registers along with the offset `5d0`.

4. `push 81e208`: This instruction pushes the value `81e208` onto the stack. The purpose of this value is not clear from the given code snippet.

5. `lea ecx, [esp + 18]`: This instruction calculates the effective address of `[esp + 18]` and stores it in the `ecx` register. The `lea` (Load Effective Address) instruction is often used to perform arithmetic calculations to calculate memory addresses.

Based on the provided assembly code, the value of the money is being loaded into the `esi` register from the calculated memory address `[ecx + eax + 5d0]`. The other instructions perform various calculations and memory operations, which may be related to the manipulation of the money value or other game-related operations.

![Assembly](https://i.imgur.com/dsx3bdA.png)

Now, let's convert the hexadecimal money value, which is represented as "cc0701," into its decimal equivalent using an online converter like RapidTables' Hex to Decimal Converter.

Converting "cc0701" from hexadecimal to decimal gives us the value 13371137.

![Decimal to Hexadecimal](https://i.imgur.com/5uc0JuH.png)

To manipulate the currency value effectively, we need to determine the `base address` of the game executable, `mb_warband.exe`. Let's delve deeper into the assembly code and locate the instruction responsible for modifying the `ecx` register because `eax` is 0 so we need ecx:

1. `mov ecx, [ecx + 140f0]`:
   This assembly instruction indicates that the `ecx` register is modified using the value at memory address `[ecx + 140f0]`.

2. Further analysis reveals that `ecx` changes at the memory address `mb_warband.exe + 177388` through the instruction `mov ecx, [mb_warband.exe + 4eb300]`.

Manipulating the In-Game Currency:
To manipulate the currency, we need to find the base address of `mb_warband.exe`. Once we have the base address, we can apply offsets to access and modify the desired memory locations.

#### Writing Code

C++ is a powerful programming language that allows you to create robust and efficient memory manipulation code for game hacking. Let's explore an example snippet that demonstrates memory manipulation using C++ in the context of Mount and Blade Warband.

#### Windows API

The Windows API is a collection of functions and data structures that allow developers to access and control various aspects of the Windows operating system. It provides an interface for interacting with processes, files, windows, networking, and other system resources. These APIs enable developers to create powerful applications that leverage the capabilities of the underlying operating system.

Let's examine the provided C++ code snippet and explore its implementation of process handling and snapshot creation using the Windows API:

```cpp
Memory(const std::string_view processName) noexcept
{
    ::PROCESSENTRY32 entry = { };
    entry.dwSize = sizeof(::PROCESSENTRY32);

    const auto snapShot = ::CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);

    while (::Process32Next(snapShot, &entry))
    {
        if (!processName.compare(entry.szExeFile))
        {
            processId = entry.th32ProcessID;
            processHandle = ::OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, processId);
            break;
        }
    }

    // Free handle
    if (snapShot)
        ::CloseHandle(snapShot);
}
```

**Process Handling and Snapshot Creation:**
1. The `Memory` constructor takes a `std::string_view` parameter called `processName`, representing the name of the target process.

2. The `::PROCESSENTRY32` structure, named `entry`, is declared and initialized with zero using the `{ }` initializer. This structure contains information about a process, such as its process ID and executable file name.

3. The `dwSize` member of the `entry` structure is set to the size of `::PROCESSENTRY32` to ensure compatibility with the Windows API functions.

4. The `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` function is called to create a snapshot of the currently running processes. It takes the `TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS` flag as the first parameter, indicating that we want to capture information about processes.

5. The returned snapshot handle is stored in the `snapShot` variable.

6. A `while` loop is used to iterate through each process entry using the `Process32Next` function and the `entry` structure. This function retrieves the next process information from the snapshot.

7. Within the loop, the `compare` function is used to check if the `processName` matches the name of the current process entry (`entry.szExeFile`).

8. If a match is found, the process ID (`entry.th32ProcessID`) is assigned to the `processId` variable.

9. The `OpenProcess` function is called to obtain a handle to the target process using the `PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS` flag, granting full access rights. The resulting handle is stored in the `processHandle` variable.

10. Once the target process is found and the handle is obtained, the loop is exited.

11. Finally, the `CloseHandle` function is called to free the snapshot handle (`snapShot`) and release system resources.

**Reading Memory**

```cpp
template <typename T>
	constexpr const T Read(const std::uintptr_t& address) const noexcept
	{
		T value = { };
		::ReadProcessMemory(processHandle, reinterpret_cast<const void*>(address), &value, sizeof(T), NULL);
		return value;
	}
```

The core of our approach is a template function called `Read`, which takes a memory address as input and returns the value stored at that address. Let's dissect the function step by step:

1. Template Declaration:
The `Read` function is declared as a template function, allowing us to specify the desired type of the value we want to read. The `typename T` syntax introduces the type parameter `T`, which will be resolved at compile-time.

2. Function Signature:
The function signature is defined as `constexpr const T Read(const std::uintptr_t& address) const noexcept`. Breaking it down:

   - `constexpr`: This keyword indicates that the function can be evaluated at compile-time if the necessary conditions are met. It allows for optimization and potentially improves performance.
   - `const T`: Specifies that the return type of the function is a constant value of type `T`.
   - `const std::uintptr_t& address`: The function takes a reference to a `std::uintptr_t` variable named `address` as its parameter. This parameter represents the memory address we want to read from.
   - `const noexcept`: These keywords indicate that the function is marked as const and noexcept, implying that it does not modify the state of the object it belongs to and does not throw exceptions.

3. Variable Initialization:
Within the function, a variable `value` of type `T` is declared and initialized using zero-initialization. This prepares the variable to store the value read from the memory address.

4. ReadProcessMemory:
The `ReadProcessMemory` function is called with the following arguments:

   - `processHandle`: This variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere and represents the handle to the target process.
   - `reinterpret_cast<const void*>(address)`: The memory address is converted to a `const void*` pointer using the `reinterpret_cast` operator. This conversion is necessary because `ReadProcessMemory` expects a pointer to the memory location to read from.
   - `&value`: The address of the `value` variable is passed as the destination for the read operation. By providing the address, we enable `ReadProcessMemory` to write the value directly into `value`.
   - `sizeof(T)`: The size of the value to read is determined using `sizeof(T)`, where `T` is the type specified when calling the `Read` function. This ensures that the correct number of bytes is read from the process's memory.
   - `NULL`: This argument indicates that no bytes were read. The `ReadProcessMemory` function sets the number of bytes read in this parameter, but since we don't need that information, we pass `NULL`.

5. Return the Read Value:
After the `ReadProcessMemory` call, the `value` variable contains the value read from the specified memory address. The function then returns this value as the result.

**Writing to Memory**

```cpp
template <typename T>
	constexpr void Write(const std::uintptr_t& address, const T& value) const noexcept
	{
		::WriteProcessMemory(processHandle, reinterpret_cast<void*>(address), &value, sizeof(T), NULL);
	}
```

The heart of our approach is a template function named `Write`, which accepts a memory address and a value, and writes the value to the specified memory address. Let's delve into the function step by step:

1. Template Declaration:
The `Write` function is declared as a template function, enabling us to specify the type of the value we want to write. The `typename T` syntax introduces the type parameter `T`, which will be resolved at compile-time.

2. Function Signature:
The function signature is defined as `constexpr void Write(const std::uintptr_t& address, const T& value) const noexcept`. Breaking it down:

   - `constexpr`: This keyword indicates that the function can be evaluated at compile-time if the necessary conditions are met. It allows for optimization and potentially improves performance.
   - `void`: Specifies that the function does not return any value.
   - `const std::uintptr_t& address`: The function takes a reference to a `std::uintptr_t` variable named `address` as the first parameter. This parameter represents the memory address we want to write to.
   - `const T& value`: The second parameter is a reference to a `const T` variable named `value`, representing the value we want to write to memory.
   - `const noexcept`: These keywords indicate that the function is marked as const and noexcept, indicating that it does not modify the state of the object it belongs to and does not throw exceptions.

3. WriteProcessMemory:
The `WriteProcessMemory` function is called with the following arguments:

   - `processHandle`: This variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere and represents the handle to the target process.
   - `reinterpret_cast<void*>(address)`: The memory address is converted to a `void*` pointer using the `reinterpret_cast` operator. This conversion is necessary because `WriteProcessMemory` expects a pointer to the memory location to write to.
   - `&value`: The address of the `value` variable is passed as the source for the write operation. By providing the address, we enable `WriteProcessMemory` to read the value directly from `value`.
   - `sizeof(T)`: The size of the value to write is determined using `sizeof(T)`, where `T` is the type specified when calling the `Write` function. This ensures that the correct number of bytes is written to the process's memory.
   - `NULL`: This argument indicates that no bytes were written. The `WriteProcessMemory` function sets the number of bytes written in this parameter, but since we don't need that information, we pass `NULL`.

#### Cheat Code

```cpp
// Include necessary headers
#include <iostream>
#include "Memory.h"

int main()
{
    // Create an instance of the Memory class and specify the game executable
    const auto mem = Memory("mb_warband.exe");
    std::cout << "Mount and Blade Warband found!" << std::endl;

    // Get the base address of the game module
    const auto base_address = mem.GetModuleAddress("mb_warband.exe");

    // Read a value from memory using an offset from the base address
    int ecx = mem.Read<int>(base_address + 0x4eb300);
    std::cout << "Value at address: " << ecx << std::endl;

    // Perform additional memory reads and manipulation
    int eax = mem.Read<int>(ecx + 0x6e0);
    ecx = mem.Read<int>(ecx + 0x140f0);
    int money = mem.Read<int>(ecx + 0x5d0);

    // Write a new value to a memory address
    mem.Write<int>(ecx + 0x5d0, 13371137);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Memory` class and specify the game executable "mb_warband.exe". We retrieve the base address of the game module and perform memory reads and manipulations by adding appropriate offsets to the base address. Finally, we write a new value to a memory address using the `Write` function.

Remember, the provided code is a simplified example for demonstration purposes, and actual memory manipulation code may vary depending on the game and the specific variables you want to modify. It's essential to understand the game's memory structure, locate the correct memory addresses, and use caution and responsibility when performing memory manipulations.

Additionally, it's crucial to implement a robust and reliable `Memory` class that handles read and write operations appropriately. This might involve using operating system-specific functions or libraries to access and modify the game's memory.

Always approach game hacking responsibly, respect the game developers' efforts, and consider the impact of your actions on the gaming community.

	mem.Write<int>(edx + 0x27c, 500);

    return 0;
}
```


## Breaking the Code: Demystifying the Inner Workings of Game Hacking Techniques
